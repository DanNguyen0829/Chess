This is my chess game that I built using Java:D
You play the game by dragging the pieces to a desired square (similar to chess.com). If a move is legal, the square will turn white, while it will turn red if the move is illegal.

All chess pieces move exactly the way they should (Disclaimer: The game doesn't warn you if you're in check or not, so don't think the program is broken if you can't move your pieces. The move may be illegal since you're in check)
